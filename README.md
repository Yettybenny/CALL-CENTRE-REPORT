# CALL-CENTRE-REPORT

## Introduction

The project is to analyze the call data for PhoneNow, a client under the management of Claire, their Call Centre Manager. 

## Objectives 

The aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of long-term trends in customer and agent interactions using Power BI. Through the creation of a detailed dashboard, this project focused on delivering actionable insights using critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to support decision-making and operational improvements.

### Data Cleaning:

Before I carried out any analysis, the call data underwent a comprehensive cleaning process to ensure accuracy and reliability

- I removed unnecessary rows to focus on the most relevant data for analysis.
- The Call ID field was converted from its initial format to text, ensuring consistent data types and avoiding issues during analysis.
- Any hidden files and unnecessary entries were filtered out to maintain the integrity of the dataset and prevent skewed results.

## Key Insights:

- Overall satisfaction was recorded at 71.33%, with Jim leading the satisfaction ratings (1819) and Joe at the lower end (1612), which shows areas for further training or support for lower-performing agents.

- Call volumes remained relatively stable across the months, with January recording the highest volume (1455 calls) and March (1301) showing a slight decrease.

- The resolution rate stood at 89.94%, leaving about 10% of issues unresolved, a key area for improvement.

- The primary issues driving customer dissatisfaction were related to Streaming and Payment related.

## Recommendations:

- Focus on training lower-performing agents like Joe to improve their speed of response and resolution rates.

- Implement feedback loops to better understand why 28.67% of customers were dissatisfied. Address specific concerns related to streaming and payment issues, as these were the most frequently mentioned problems.
- Regularly monitor monthly call volumes to allocate resources more efficiently, ensuring that agents are well-equipped during peak call times such as January.
